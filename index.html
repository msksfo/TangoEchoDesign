					<p><img class='profilePicture' src='images/profile-pic.jpg' alt='Image of Tia in the Super Decathalon'>Hi. My name is Tia. Tango and Echo are the initials of my first and last name, as assigned by the <abbr title='North Atlantic Treaty Organization'>NATO</abbr> phonetic alphabet. This is the alphabet used in the aviation industy. I currently work with American Airlines at San Francisco International Airport. I applied for this job because I love traveling. At the time of my application, I couldn't tell the difference between a 737 and an A320. Some time passed. I traveled a lot. Then I married a pilot, and, well...aviation grows on you. We've been to all seven continents, which is meaningless but kind of cool at the same time. Aviation will always be a part of my life, which is why I decided to use Tango Echo in my design name.</p>

					<p>I'm currently studying web development and I plan to seek full time employment in this field in 2018. Why am I leaving the airline industry? While I've enjoyed my time there, I'm nearly elgible to keep, for life, the flight benefits that I've worked so hard for. This has been my goal from day one. Having reached that goal, I'd like to pursue a job that offers more of an intellectual challenge. One of the reasons that tech appeals to me is because it's constantly changing, growing. I will never be finished learning. My brain will never be bored. </p>

					<p>My educational background is in piano performance. Now at first it seems like music and programming have nothing in common whatsoever. But look beneath the surface, and you'll see how well skills developed in the practice room translate to programming. From being a musician I learned dedication, persistence, consistency. I learned *how* to practice (learned how to learn, in other words). I learned how to make goals, manage my time, how to collaborate with others. If these are too broad, how about pattern recognition, intense focus on the details while keeping in mind how they fit into the bigger picture. These skills sound very much like the skills that make a good progammer.</p>
